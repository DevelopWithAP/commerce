# Commerce
This is my implementation of Harvard's CS50 project 2. It is an e-commerce site similar to e-Bay where users can post products,
add comments on specific products as well as add to their watchlist.

## Concepts aquired.
* This was the first time interacting with a database during this course. 
* Gained familiarity with using Django's Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
* Utilised both the Admin interface as well as the shell to interact database tables.
* Utilised OOP principles to produce cleaner implementations of certain views.
